# README

Language Master is a Rails application for collecting grammar structures and allowing users to enter practice sentences using that grammar. These sentences can then be checked and corrected by native speakers and added to the library of example sentences for their respective grammar point.

This is a very early version with only basic functionality.

## INSTALLATION

Just the normal Rails app install procedure.

Remember to run `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate` before you run it.
